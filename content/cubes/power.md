## Thoughts

  * Seeded packs based on round, 5x9
      * Rounds 1-5 have a land slot, fetches and duals (1 each)
      * Rounds 1-3 have a power slot, containing one card from the Power 12:
          * {{< card Black Lotus >}}
          * Moxen ({{< xcard name="Mox Pearl" label="Pearl" />}}, {{< xcard name="Mox Sapphire" label="Sapphire" />}}, {{< xcard name="Mox Jet" label="Jet" />}}, {{< xcard name="Mox Ruby" label="Ruby" />}}, {{< xcard name="Mox Emerald" label="Emerald" />}})
          * {{< card Ancestral Recall >}}
          * {{< card Time Walk >}}
          * {{< card Sol Ring >}}
          * {{< card Mana Crypt >}}
          * {{< card Timetwister >}} (?)
          * {{< card Library of Alexandria >}} (?)
          * {{< card Power Play >}} (?)
  * Probably not color-balanced, blue's just going to have a few more cards than the other colors
