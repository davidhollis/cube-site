description: "A cube with an unusually high density of enchantments and somewhat commander-y gameplay"
draft: false
---

Enchantment has been my favorite card type since about when I started playing Magic, _\[redacted]_ years ago. Support for (and answers to) enchantments aren't evenly distributed through the color pie, so I expanded the set of things to do in this cube beyond "jam a bunch of enchantments and enchantresses in your deck and call it a day." Decks will generally still _contain_ more enchantments than normal, though, even if they aren't built around it.


## The Draft

In a normal draft, 4 players draft the entire cube in 5 packs of 9 cards each.

The packs are collated so that they contain at least one card of each color and at least one multicolor card. In addition, each pack has exactly one nonbasic land.


## Power Level

This cube had a kinda commander-y feel: games tend to be on the slow side, and people are making big plays. There's some interaction, but it skews heavily toward enchantment removal. It's possible to draft a deck that can curve out, though, so even slower decks should have some plan to not die to {{< card Satyr Hoplite >}}.


## Fixing

The nonbasic lands are all either enemy-color duals or wedge-colored triomes. There are no mana rocks, and most of green's ramp is mana doubling or more green mana. Most drafters will wind up in 3 colors, or 2 with a splash.


## Supported Themes

This cube is pretty open-ended, but the following themes are present in large enough numbers to build around:

  * {{< mana w b g >}} **Constellation:** Things that trigger when you cast enchantments or when they enter the battlefield (classic Enchantress stuff), and some graveyard recursion.
  * {{< mana u r w >}} **Heroic:** Cast protective spells and auras on your efficient, evasive creatures.
  * {{< mana b g u >}} **Panharmonicon:** Double up on triggered abilities. Don't forget about {{< card Paradox Haze >}}.
  * {{< mana r w b >}} **Control/Prison:** Assemble a collection of lock pieces while amassing value, and maybe eventually win.
  * {{< mana g u r >}} **Ramp:** Generate ridiculous amounts of mana, then find something to dump it all into. {{< card Helix Pinnacle >}} is probably a trap, but I refuse to take it out of the cube.
  * {{< mana w u b r g >}} **Shrines:** The cube contains all 17 shrines. The fixing isn't good enough to reliably build a true 5-color deck, but there's enough shrines that more than one player can get a critical mass across ~3 colors. And hey, if you've got all the green shrines, you might be able to make the full WUBRG happen.
