description: "A cube where creature types matter, a lot. There are 22 supported types!"
draft: false
---

A kind of puzzle-y cube. There are **22** supported creature types, but none of them have enough support that you can build a deck just around that type. Each deck will be a mixture of several types. For example, you won't be able to build a Shaman deck, but you _can_ build a Minotair-Shaman-Rogue-Giant deck.


## The Draft

In a normal draft, 4 players draft the entire cube in 5 packs of 9 cards each.

The packs are very strictly collated, and the slots are as follows:

  1. A monowhite card
  2. A monoblue card
  3. A monoblack card
  4. A monored card
  5. A monogreen card
  6. A colorless (50%) or two-color (50%) card
  7. A monocolor Sliver (50%) or Ally (50%) card
  8. A monocolor creature with changeling
  9. A tapland that agins life when it enters the battlefield (like {{< card Scoured Barrens >}})

In terms of creature type distributions, the cube is designed such that if any card references a creature type in its rules text, you should be able to find several other non-changeling cards of that type in that card's color(s). There are two exceptions to this rule:

  1. There are some party cards in white and black. Each of those colors has two of the party types in decent numbers, so you should be able to get some value, but for a full party, you'll need to splash another color or pick up some changelings.
  2. Slivers and Allies exist in small numbers across all colors. There are ten Slivers (2 per color) and ten Allies (also 2 per color).

**The golden rule is: If you see a creature type referenced in a text box, it's not a trap. The cube has creatures of that type.**


## Fixing

The only real nongreen fixing in the cube are the tapped duals in the land slot. They're plentiful enough to enable splashing, but you'll probably want to keep yourself in two primary colors.


## The Supported Types

_(None of this info is required to draft the cube, but it's here in case it's interesting)_

Each color has two supported types. There are at least 5 cards with that type in that color.

  * {{< mana w >}} Rebels, Angels
  * {{< mana u >}} Faeries, Wizards
  * {{< mana b >}} Vampires, Rogues
  * {{< mana r >}} Shamans, Giants
  * {{< mana g >}} Druids, Squirrels

In addition, each color pair has a type supported across both of its colors. There is one gold card of that type and at least five monocolor cards between the two (e.g., for {{< mana wu >}}, there is one {{< mana w u >}} Spirit card, three {{< mana w >}} Spirit cards, and three {{< mana u >}} Spirit cards).

  * {{< mana wu >}} Spirits
  * {{< mana ub >}} Ninjas
  * {{< mana br >}} Minotaurs
  * {{< mana rg >}} Elementals
  * {{< mana gw >}} Cats
  * {{< mana wb >}} Clerics
  * {{< mana ur >}} Pirates
  * {{< mana bg >}} Fungi
  * {{< mana rw >}} Warriors
  * {{< mana gu >}} Merfolk

Finally, there are two types supported in all colors: Slivers and Allies. There's two monocolor Slivers and two monocolor Allies in each color.
