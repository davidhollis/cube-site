## Thoughts

  * Cube supports Contraptions and Attractions
      * They're not drafted, they're drawn as needed from a shared deck
          * 2x of each common and uncommon
              * with different activation patterns for Attractions
          * 1x of each rare and mythic
      * After each game, any extra deck cards that were present in that game are shuffled and put on the bottom of their corresponding shared deck
  * Land slot: probably gain lands
