description: "A 4-player cube that turns into a 4-player free-for-all multiplayer game"
draft: true
---

This one started from a kinda unique place: the initial idea was to have a 4-seat draft where the drafters could just stay in their seats for a free-for-all multiplayer game afterward. The power level would be "classic casual magic with focused decks". After a bit of messing around with some ideas, I decided to incorporate conspiracies and draft-matters cards, and that in turn led me to breaking singleton—the Hidden Agenda conspiracies get a lot better if you can name a card you have more than one of in your deck.

The other design consideration was making sure that the major themes all moved the game toward a conclusion. Multiplayer games already tend to go long, so there needed to be some encouragement to attack (or compulsion to attack, in the case of goad), and themes that naturally lend themselves to stopping combat (like defenders) need to have a clear way to win.


## The Draft

In a normal draft, 4 players draft the entire cube in 5 packs of 9 cards each.

The packs are collated so that they each contain:

  1. A land
  2. A draft matters card (a Conspiracy or other card that somehow involves decisions made during the draft or during deckbuilding).
  3. A monowhite card
  4. A monoblue card
  5. A monoblack card
  6. A monored card
  7. A monogreen card
  8. A gold card
  9. Either an artifact (50%) or a monocolor card (50%, any color equally likely)


### Rarity

Each color has one common card that occurs four times. These are cards like {{< card Squadron Hawk >}} that directly ask you to run as many copies as possible. Each color also has two uncommon cards that occur twice each. In addition, there are two uncommon artifacts. Every other card is a "rare"—it occurs just once in the cube.


### Lore Seeker

The cube contains {{< card Lore Seeker >}}, and whoever drafts it gets first pick out of a special pack of cards not normally in the cube. I sifted through my "commander good stuff box" to find a few cards of each color, and the Lore Seeker pack is 9 random cards from that pool. After the games, the cards are removed from the pool and replaced with new ones, so the Lore Seeker pack is completely new every time.


## Fixing

The nonbasic lands are all either allied-color duals or shard-colored triomes. The artifact slot contains one each of the allied-color talismans. Most players will wind up in 3 colors, or 2 with a splash.


## Supported Themes

The cube is focused on general multiplayer gameplay, with five loose archetypes distributed across shards, plus a few notable cycles across all colors.

  * {{< mana g w u >}} **Bant: Flicker** {{< mana u w g >}}  
    Creatures with powerful enters-the-battlefield abilities, plus ways to re-use them.
  * {{< mana w u b >}} **Esper: Voting Control** {{< mana b u w >}}  
    The average Esper deck will probably be a more controlling deck, but there's a number of cards that put their effects to a vote, as well as a few ways to put your thumb on the scale.
  * {{< mana u b r >}} **Grixis: Curses** {{< mana r b u >}}  
    Enchant your opponents and slowly grind their boards, hands, and life totals down. Or just incentivize other players to attack each other.
  * {{< mana b r g >}} **Jund: Cast from exile** {{< mana g r b >}}  
    Cards that pay you off for casting spells from places other than your hand, plus ways to do that (suspend, cascade, foretell, adventures, and more)
  * {{< mana r g w >}} **Naya: Attacking** {{< mana w g r >}}  
    Turn creatures sideways!

Across all colors, you can find:

  * **Defenders:** Each color has a few cards that either are defenders themselves or that reward you for playing a lot of defenders.
  * **Impetuses:** An Aura that points your opponents' creatures away from you.
  * **Monarch:** Every color has one card that brings the monarch into the game.
