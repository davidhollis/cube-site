description: "A vintage-inspired cube meant to show off the many facets of the color red"
draft: true
---

This cube is my attempt at showcasing many different facets of red as a color. It's relatively high-power, inspired by decks from the MTGO vintage cube, as well as different mono-red Canadian Highlander decks.


## The Draft

In a normal draft, 4 players draft the entire cube in 5 packs of 9 cards each.

Packs are collated so that each one contains a land.


### Snow Lands

Drafters are normally only allowed to add ordinary basic mountains to their decks during construction; however, the cube contains two copies of {{< card Snow-Covered Mountain >}}. Drafting one or more of these snow mountains "unlocks" the ability to add snow mountains to your deck during construction.


## Supported Themes

This cube was not designed around specific archetypes: since every card can go in anyone's deck, drafting here is more an effort in crafting a consistent game plan for your deck (rather than, say, finding your lane among a set of 10 established decks). It should be possible[^1] to build aggro decks like you might see in a classic vintage cube, goblin decks, {{< xcard name="Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker" label="Kiki" />}} combo decks, midrange decks with dragons or planeswalkers, storm decks, and various types of artifact decks.
