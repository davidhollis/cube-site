This is a cube built around multiple expressions of graveyard mechanics. It's one of the oldest ideas for a themed cube I had, germinating from the seed of "how many cards with cycling can I put in a cube?" Everything else evolved from that idea.


## The Draft

In a normal draft, 4 players draft the entire cube in 5 packs of 9 cards each.

The packs are collated so that they contain at least one card of each color. Most packs (17/20) contain a nonbasic land with cycling. Half of the packs contain a multicolor card that acts as a signpost for what its color pair is trying to do.


## Supported Themes

The predominant archetypes are:

  * **Cycling** (primarily {{< mana w >}}, spread across all colors):
      * **Cycling Triggers** ({{< mana w u >}}): Set up a {{< card Drake Haven >}} or an {{< card Astral Drift >}} and get yourself extra value whenever you cycle.
      * **Cycling Aggro** ({{< mana w r >}}): Red and white have some of the aggressive cycling payoffs from Ikoria and Amonkhet, and {{< card Zenith Flare >}} to end the game.
  * **Control** ({{< mana u b >}}): Use your graveyard as a resource to bury your opponent in incremental advantage.
  * **Madness** ({{< mana b r >}}): Discard cards and get paid off for doing so.
  * **Loam** ({{< mana g >}}): However you do it, just get some lands into your graveyard
      * **Knight** ({{< mana g w >}}): Creatures like {{< card Knight of the Reliquary >}} churn through lands, triggering {{< card "Titania, Protector of Argoth" >}} on the way out, or {{< card Field of the Dead >}} on the way in.
      * **Discarding Lands** ({{< mana g r >}}): {{< card Seismic Assault >}} and other ways to discard lands, plus {{< card Life from the Loam >}} to do it again
      * **Dredge** ({{< mana g b >}}): Dredge out your library and win with {{< card Worm Harvest >}}.
  * **Draw your second card** ({{< mana u r >}}): Spread out your draws and time your cycling carefully to maximize your {{< card Irencrag Pyromancer >}} and {{< card Improbable Alliance >}} triggers.
  * **Value Reanimator** ({{< mana w b >}}): Use {{< card "Lurrus of the Dream-Den" >}} to recur small permanents over and over again.
  * **Self-Mill** ({{< mana g u >}}): Mill yourself and get value from your graveyard, aiming to win with {{< card Laboratory Maniac >}} or just to get value with {{< card "Shigeki, Jukai Visionary" >}} and {{< card Colossal Skyturtle >}}.
