## Thoughts

  * Kind of a "live the dream"-type thing, but more focused on the dreams that involve board presence and can be described as "big"
  * Extremely generous fixing
      * Land slot with all 10 fetches and all 10 triomes.
      * Artifact slot with signets
  * Some possible themes:
      * Cascade
      * Mutate
      * Counters
          * Proliferate
          * Level Up
      * Ramp
          * {{< mana x >}} spells
      * Auras
      * Equipment
      * Tokens
      * Legends
  * Possibly slightly skewed toward green
      * A lot of these mechanics want to eat up some of green's space
  * Removal mostly slow and a bit more expensive than usual (3+ mana), but mostly unconditional
      * Sweepers at 6+
