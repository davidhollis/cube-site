description: "A color-restricted cube built around casting instant and sorcery spells"
draft: false
---

This is a cube built around casting instants and sorcery spells: casting a lot of them, or from particular zones, or to do particular things. The cube is color-restricted: there are only blue, red, and green cards.


## The Draft

In a normal draft, 4 players draft the entire cube in 5 packs of 9 cards each.

The packs are collated so that they each contain:

  * At least two blue cards
  * At least two red cards
  * At least two green cards
  * At least one land or mana rock
  * At least one multicolor card


## Errata

There is one card that has been modified so that it works differently than normal: {{< card Spider Spawning >}}. Its flashback cost has been modified to include blue mana instead of black, to support a self-mill deck:

> Spider Spawning  
> {{< mana 4 g >}}  
> Sorcery  
> Create a 1/2 green Spider creature token with reach for each creature card in your graveyard.  
> Flashback {{< mana 6 u >}} _(You may cast this card from your graveyard for its flashback cost. Then exile it.)_

This change is marked on the card.


## Supported Themes

While this cube is pretty open-ended (you can draft a good deck that doesn't fit neatly into any of the following), these themes have specific support built-in:

  * {{< mana u r >}} blue/red {{< mana r u >}}
      * **Aggro** ({{< card Kiln Fiend >}}, {{< card Thermo-Alchemist >}}, {{< card "Dragon's Rage Channeler" >}})
      * **Tempo** ({{< card Delver of Secrets >}}, {{< card Enigma Drake >}})
      * **Graveyard** ({{< card Burning Vengeance >}}, lots of flashback and retrace)
      * **Tokens** ({{< card Young Pyromancer >}}, {{< card "Saheeli, Sublime Artificer" >}})
  * {{< mana r g >}} red/green {{< mana g r >}}
      * **Storm** (rituals on sticks like {{< card "Birgi, God of Storytelling" >}}, cost reducers, {{< card Chatterstorm >}})
      * **{{< card Wildfire >}} Ramp**
      * **Tokens** (grind them into the {{< card Chitterspitter >}}, double up your spells with {{< card "Wort, the Raidmother" >}}, or just overrun with {{< card Garruk Wildspeaker >}})
  * {{< mana g u >}} green/blue {{< mana u g >}}
      * **Kicker** (exactly what it sounds like! Get extra effects out of your spells, or even copy them with {{< card "Verazol, the Split Current" >}})
      * **Flicker** (re-use ETB abilities, or go infinite with {{< card Peregrine Drake >}})
      * **Self-mill** (flash back big token-makers, or build up a {{< card Spider Spawning >}} loop with {{< card "Memory's Journey" >}} and {{< card Runic Repetition >}})
