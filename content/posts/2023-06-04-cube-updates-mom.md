Time for a Big Quarterly Update™!

<!--more-->

For most of the cubes, I don't have a ton to say that isn't addressed in either the CubeCobra updates or [my MOM+ Set Review](/posts/2023-06-04-set-review-mom). In fact, I drew the updates up with my set review open in another window as the source.

  * [Spellslinger updates](https://cubecobra.com/cube/blog/blogpost/e9d11609-a7fc-480f-b4b1-9cc69d8a639a)
  * [Graveyard updates](https://cubecobra.com/cube/blog/blogpost/efd6f00b-1595-45c7-92b9-f745f432a897) (plus I [added Rona](https://cubecobra.com/cube/blog/blogpost/454cd57d-d600-4d2b-b2a4-846d619d3ff7))
  * [Multiplayer updates](https://cubecobra.com/cube/blog/blogpost/2ca60dc1-914c-45f2-acae-a50fe0daffcb)
  * [Red cube updates](https://cubecobra.com/cube/blog/blogpost/b6b63cca-09c2-4509-8521-d8351c87742d)

But I can spare a few more words for the others:


## [Enchantment Updates](https://cubecobra.com/cube/blog/blogpost/bf2c7e17-8d61-4983-948c-029acf27939c)

The last time my group drafted this one was the first time the heroic deck really came together, and it was... not great. I drafted it, and I got almost every card I could've wanted, including some excellent wheels. During the games, though, I often had trouble curving out due to the atrocious mana. I say, "atrocious," but if I'd been playing a deck that wanted to go long it would've been just fine. The available fixing just isn't set up to enbale a 3-color aggro deck.

Now, I _could_ change the fixing around, but most of the decks are fine with a longer game. Instead I chose to try concentrating more of the deck's power in white. We'll see if a version of the deck can succeed with white as the primary color, either blue or red secondary, and at most a minor splash into the other. If a more 2-color version of the deck still struggles, I can try adding a few more early white creatures like {{< card Phalanx Leader >}} or {{< card Akroan Skyguard >}}. I also switched out the "signpost" from {{< card Jeskai Ascendancy >}} (which I was never very happy with—heroic is not the kind of combo deck that wants a JA) to the new {{< card "Narset, Enlightened Exile" >}}. I hope that new Narset can help enable some longer-game plays.

Another thing on my mind is that if Heroic still doesn't want to work out, I might be able to design a new token deck with some of the convoke machinery from MOM.


## [Tribal Soup Updates](https://cubecobra.com/cube/blog/blogpost/6b7d9f5c-4bb2-405c-a37b-9bfe9248d886)

The last draft of this cube forced me to come to two conclusions:

 1. There is no 5c allies deck, because the allies are strongly bimodal: either so bad they never make the cut even with other allies, or so good they'd get played with zero other allies. The latter case is problematic because it means that the reasons to go into the deck would never come together because (for example) the squirrels drafter would take {{< card Turntimber Ranger >}} just on the strength of how much power and toughness it puts on the field.
 2. There is no 5c slivers deck, because most of the slivers are "ability lords", and stacking up ability lords won't always build you a good enough board the way stacking up +1/+1 lords will. A drafter tried to force slivers, ended up with all the slivers they could desire, and found themselves cutting them in favor of changelings and the likes of {{< card Supreme Phantom >}}. Slivers just work better in consructed, where you can run 4x {{< card Muscle Sliver >}}.

So I decided to cut allies entirely and expand slivers to be a longer-game deck built around activated and triggered abilities. I had trouble finding a set of 20 color-balanced slivers with interesting abilities, so I settled on 15 and decided they'd no longer get a dedicated booster slot like they used to. The cube now contains:

  * Two slivers of each single color, shuffled in with the rest of that color when collating
  * Five 2-color slivers (a color-balanced mix of ally and enemy) and {{< card The First Sliver >}}, shuffled in with the gold cards when collating.

That left 5 more slots left over from removing allies. I gave each color a "choose a creature type" card, except for green which already had {{< card Realmwalker >}} (and the next best option was a sharp drop-off from there). Green got {{< card Embiggen >}}, which I've been wanting to try in the cube since it came out.
