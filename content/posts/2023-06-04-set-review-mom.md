## White

### Alabaster Host Intercessor

{{< card-listing "Alabaster Host Intercessor" >}}

Just, uh, wow. There's a lot of cards that'd be playable with `<land-type>cycling {2}` on them. {{< card Noble Templar >}} is probably cubeable, and the only other ability that one has is _(checks notes)_ vigilance? So, the cube that really wants this is the [graveyard slice][graveyard], but the real question is whether this is better than {{< card Angel of the Ruins >}}. Angel doesn't always have targets, but it's a huge flier, and when it does have targets it's backbreaking. Intercessor will almost always take something out, but it doesn't end the game as effectively. But it's more castable!

I'm going to try it out. It's a $0.04 card.


### Boon-Bringer Valkyrie

{{< card-listing "Boon-Bringer Valkyrie" >}}

Powerful card that's in two relevant creature types for [tribal soup][tribal], but after cutting {{< card Lyra Dawnbringer >}} went so well I'm pretty sure that cube doesn't need any literal baneslayers. Still, this is one of the best baneslayers they've ever printed, so throw it in the pile for the next time a cube needs it.


### Dusk Legion Duelist

{{< card-listing "Dusk Legion Duelist" >}}

I don't know that I have a cube that wants this, but I'd be remiss if I didn't call out a white 2-drop that draws cards. Saving this for the next time I build a cube that has a +1/+1 counter theme that touches white.


### Elesh Norn

{{< card-listing "Elesh Norn" "The Argent Etchings" >}}

Nope, not interested. Yeah, it's powerful, but not in a fun or interesting way. If you can't flip it, it just bogs the game down in triggers with optional costs. If you can, you read out a bunch of chapter abilities that say "you win the game" in a few more words.


### Guardian of Ghirapur

{{< card-listing "Guardian of Ghirapur" >}}

Man, the _rate_ on this compared to good ol' {{< card Flickerwisp >}}. Those two extra points of toughness and one fewer white pip matter, but the limitation to just artifacts or creatures (and only that you control) hurts. Ultimately, I don't think this displaces Flickerwisp anywhere, but I like cards that don't compare cleanly to existing staples. And hey, maybe someone has a cube where the removal suite and relative creature sizes make the stats matter more than the clever plays!


### Invasion of Gobakhan

{{< card-listing "Invasion of Gobakhan" "Lightshield Array" >}}

A very nice, cheap, disruptive white spell. I'm going to grab a few copies because I'm confident they'll make their way into a cube someday. There just often isn't room for cards like this in heavily themed cubes when they don't directly support the theme. If only this were an enchantment instead of a battle!


### Invasion of Theros

{{< card-listing "Invasion of Theros" "Ephara, Ever-Sheltering" >}}

Now _this_ is an enchantment battle! I'm certain I'll find room for this in the [enchantment slice][enchantment]. It's mostly an aura tutor, but there are a couple God and Demigod hits. Obviously if you can flip it that's huge, but I think it'll still be playable if not, especially in a slower prison deck.


### Knight-Errant of Eos

{{< card-listing "Knight-Errant of Eos" >}}

If I had written this up a few days ago I might've skipped right over this card. It's been recently making some waves in a very glass-cannon-y deck in Pioneer where you can convoke it out as early as turn 2. While I don't anticipate it doing exactly that in a singleton format, in that deck it does a pretty good job of being a rather large creature that you can double-spell with easily, and helping aggressive {{< mana rw >}} decks refuel after they've dumped their hands. This is on the short list for the [forthcoming token slice][tokens].


### Progenitor Exarch

{{< card-listing "Progenitor Exarch" >}}

Not 100% sure this makes it into the [token slice][tokens] just on rate, but that sure does make several artifact tokens. I'll probably throw it in the initial list, and we'll see if it makes the cut.


### Realmbreaker's Grasp

{{< card-listing "Realmbreaker's Grasp" >}}

A strict downgrade compared to last set's {{< card Planar Disruption >}}, which is a wild thing to say given how much better this card is than the {{< card Arrest >}}s of yesteryear.


### Seal from Existence

{{< card-listing "Seal from Existence" >}}

I actually think this is a credible option over {{< card Banishing Light >}} in environments where the {{< mana w w >}} isn't too punishing. Ward {{< mana 3 >}} is huge.


### Sunder the Gateway

{{< card-listing "Sunder the Gateway" >}}

What a sweet card! This is exactly the kind of {{< card Reclamation Sage >}} I want in a theoretical future [token slice][tokens] (I've typed out `token slice` enough times that I'm starting to get _ideas_...). And yes, I know it's not _really_ a Rec Sage unless you pay 4, but getting like 2/3 of a Rec Sage for 2 with the option of paying another 2 to get the rest sounds good to me.


### Sunfall

{{< card-listing Sunfall >}}

If you're in the market for a 5-mana wrath, this is an _impressive_ one. Exiling and giving you something resembling a board presence before your opponent gets a chance to get ahead of you are both useful attributes.


## Blue


### Change the Equation

{{< card-listing "Change the Equation" >}}

I'm normally not the biggest fan of color hate, but I think this is better than {{< card Flashfreeze >}} in the [spellslinger slice][spellslinger].


### Chrome Host Seedshark

{{< card-listing "Chrome Host Seedshark" >}}

Widely regarded as one of the sweetest cards in the set, I'm excited to try this out in the [spellslinger slice][spellslinger]. I think it replaces {{< card Metallurgic Summonings >}}. While the shark is more mana-intensive long-term, being a 3-mana flying threat seems like a strong upside. In particular, the big problem with Summonings is that by the time you can spend 5 mana on it, you've often cast a lot of your spells already! Seedshark comes down early enough that you're much more likely to still have some action in hand.


### Ephara's Dispersal

{{< card-listing "Ephara's Dispersal" >}}

I don't think this fits into any of my cubes, but the art is gorgeous.

It can probably do some serious work in a pauper cube, though. {{< mana 2 u >}} for bounce and draw is below the curve even in those environments, but if you've got a longer-term game plan I'll bet you can make this cost {{< mana u >}} often enough to be worth it.


### Faerie Mastermind

{{< card-listing "Faerie Mastermind" >}}

This doesn't align directly with any of the themes of my cubes; I've got a little "draw _your_ second card" synergy (like {{< card Faerie Vandal >}} and {{< card Irecrag Pyromancer >}}), but Yuta doesn't enable that as well as just having a lot of cycling and cantrips. Where I think he _could_ shine is the [multiplayer slice][multiplayer], since there's just more ways to incidentally draw a card as other opponents try to keep their hands full, and more opportunities to active the ability as the games tend to go long.


### Invasion of Segovia

{{< card-listing "Invasion of Segovia" "Caetus, Sea Tyrant of Segovia" >}}

Sweet card! It does a lot of things, but you really need to be able to flip it for it to be playable. That makes me hesitant to call it strong, because I think to really shine it needs an environment:

* where blue decks have ways to attack battles, and
* where blue decks can take advantage of those 1/1 tokens.

Ultimately, I'm unsure about the home, but I _want_ to play with this card.


### Jin-Gitaxias

{{< card-listing "Jin-Gitaxias" "The Great Synthesis" >}}

Another miss for me among the praetors. I like the game this asks you to play (try to fill up your hand, especially with big noncreature spells), but they statted it so high that the minigame doesn't matter! It's a huge creature that's hard to kill. Sure, you win the game by jumping through the hoops he holds up for you, but you can probably also win the game by attacking with your 5/5.

If this were maybe a 3-power card, where you had to build around it to be good, I'd be a lot more excited to put it in a cube. As is, you just jam this in any deck that can cast it, which is a lot less interesting.


### Meeting of the Minds

{{< card-listing "Meeting of the Minds" >}}

Any draw-two with a cost reduction ability has very high upside if you can find a home for it. I don't have any cubes where this can really do its thing. The closest is probably [spellslinger][spellslinger] (which can definitely produce tokens in {{< mana ur >}}), but it just has better options that don't ask you to be making tokens first.

Still, I'm filing this away with {{< card Thoughtcast >}}. I don't think it's as powerful as Thoughtcast because it doesn't align as well with common blue themes, but I could absolutely see this finding a niche in cubes that have big token themes that touch blue.


### Moment of Truth

{{< card-listing "Moment of Truth" >}}

Hey, they found another version of {{< card Impulse >}} / {{< card Telling Time >}} / {{< card Strategic Planning >}} / {{< card A Little Chat >}}! I like that there's so many options in this space that aren't strictly better than one another. Usually Impulse will be the best, but if your graveyard matters, Strategic Planning could be a better choice. Moment of Truth occupying the space "between" those doesn't bode well for it, but maybe filling your graveyard and being an instant matter for different decks and Moment is the perfect card for that situation. More options is more better.


### Omen Hawker

{{< card-listing "Omen Hawker" >}}

If you're taking a drink every time I say, "this is a powerful card I'm keeping my eye on, but I don't think it fits any of my current cubes," _what are you doing? Please stop, that's a **terrible** idea._

But yeah, I suspect lots of cubes that are larger than mine will be happy to include this friend. Blue 1-drops tapping for two mana are worth noting, even if they read as having a heavy restriction.


### Rona, Herald of Invasion

{{< card-listing "Rona, Herald of Invasion" "Rona, Tolarian Obliterator" >}}

New best looter? It's definitely either this or {{< card "Jace, Vryn's Prodigy" >}} (with {{< card "Jacob Hauken, Inspector" >}} in third). They both start from a powerful baseline of "{{< mana 1 u >}} for a looter that upgrades itself later in the game." Ultimately, I think JVP is better if you mostly want the game to go longer after transformation, and Rona is better if you want to close out the game at that point.

But if your cube wants a looter (it probably does!), I don't think you can go wrong with their one. I'm happy with my current set of looters, but I'm grabbing a few copies of Rona because I expect to need them some day.


### Saiba Cryptomancer

{{< card-listing "Saiba Cryptomancer" >}}

It's the blue {{< card Snakeskin Veil >}}!


### See Double

{{< card-listing "See Double" >}}

Baseline is an instant-speed split card {{< card Clone >}}//{{< card Fork >}}, and it only goes up from there. The fact that it's an _instant_ that does all the things makes it an auto-include in the [spellslinger slice][spellslinger]. A bonus: in that environment, your opponent will often fill up their graveyard for you!


### Tidal Terror

{{< card-listing "Tidal Terror" >}}

Hey, another landcycler. I don't have as many things to say about this as I did the white one. Given that I don't think anyone has ever actually cast a {{< card Shoreline Ranger >}} in my [graveyard slice][graveyard], I don't think there's much downside to swapping this in to see how it does. I don't foresee the abilith being useful, but 5/6 is keyword: big.


## Black


### Archpriest of Shadows

{{< card-listing "Archpriest of Shadows" >}}

Strong fair reanimation. I put this in a similar category as {{< card Nullpriest of Oblivion >}}. Nullpriest guarantees you one reanimation for one extra mana, but Archpriest has more stats for the mana and a higher ceiling. Not going in any of my cubes today, but on the list for future consideration.


### Breach the Multiverse

{{< card-listing "Breach the Multiverse" >}}

Huge, sweet, game-ending card for the [multiplayer slice][multiplayer]. Not much more to say about that. It'll probably rotate out once it's been cast a few times, but it's very emblematic of the kinds of plays that cube is trying to do.


### The swampcyclers

{{< card-listing "Gloomfang Mauler" "Injector Crocodile" >}}

The swampcylers in this set are sweet (I really like Gloomfang in particular), but neither of them displace {{< xcard name="Twisted Abomination" label="Twisted A-bom" />}} in the [graveyard slice][graveyard]. The regeneration is just too good.


### Hoarding Broodlord

{{< card-listing "Hoarding Broodlord" >}}

Definitely trying this out in the multiplayer cube to add another payoff for the jund cast-from-exile theme. Probably not a real consideration for cubes in general, but it happens to find a great niche in my weird one.


### Invasion of Fiora

{{< card-listing "Invasion of Fiora" "Marchesa, Resolute Monarch" >}}

I think this finds its way into the [multiplayer slice][multiplayer], since it doesn't really have any black sweepers. It'll be rare for it to be a {{< card Plague Wind >}}, but I don't think that's a bug. The only thing that makes me unsure is this is the third expensive black card I said I wanted to try in that cube, and that list is pretty tight because it's a small cube that breaks singleton.

I also think this is a strong choice for the [Timmy slice][timmy] when that comes together, because I think I want the wraths to come in around 6 mana for that one, and this plays nicely with the legendary theme I assume it will have.


### Invasion of Innistrad

{{< card-listing "Invasion of Innistrad" "Deluge of the Dead" >}}

Midrange all-star. I'm not seeing a place where this goes in any of my cubes (yes, I _know_ I have one with a graveyard theme) at the moment, but it's simply powerful enough that I think it deserves a note. It's below the curve but still technically playable on the front side (being effectively unconditional helps) and hard to flip, but if you do flip it you get a huge amount of inevitability. Notably, a lot of its power comes from the fact where there's some games where you can use the removal ability to arrange to flip it before your opponent has a chance to plan around it.


### Pile On

{{< card-listing "Pile On" >}}

Now _this_ is a 4-mana removal spell! Or is it? Casting this for {{< mana 3 b >}} is not Plan A, but sometimes you need to kill something, and `Surveil 2` is a rather large upside. Enough of an upside when graveyards matter that I'm going to slip this into the [graveyard slice][graveyard], replacing {{< card Murderous Compulsion >}}, which just hasn't played out the way I hoped it might (sorry Brian Kibler!).


### Sheoldred

{{< card-listing "Sheoldred" "The True Scriptures" >}}

Man, they really shot high with these praetors, and not in a good way. Bundle of aggressively-costed stats that just eats a creature your opponent spent a card on, no real obstacle to flipping, and the back side wins you the game with little opportunity for counter-play. I feel like every cube has some room for stright-up powerful auto-picks, but I'd rather those at least be cards that have fun or interesting play patterns, and these just _don't_.


## Red


### Beamtown Beatstick

{{< card-listing "Beamtown Beatstick" >}}

Winner of the best name award for this set, and a surprising little common. It doesn't do _everything_, but it does a lot for how litte you have to invest. I think I'm going to try it in the [tokens slice][tokens] when that happens, but I also think this might just make its way into pauper cubes.


### Chandra, Hope's Beacon

{{< card-listing "Chandra, Hope's Beacon" >}}

I don't know if my [mono-red slice][red] has room for two {{< xcard name="Chandra, Awakened Inferno" label="6-mana Chandras" />}}, but I'm sure going to try. If two is too many, then this is probably one that gets cut because I prefer the play pattern of Awakened Inferno in a planeswalker midrange deck. But if I do cut it, maybe I'll see if it goes in [spellslinger][spellslinger]. It's a card that's fun, strong, and not unbeatable.


### City on Fire

{{< card-listing "City on Fire" >}}

Not much to say about this other than I'm going to swap it in for {{< card Fiery Emancipation >}} in the [enchantment slice][enchantment].


### Etali, Primal Conqueror

{{< card-listing "Etali, Primal Conqueror" "Etali, Primal Sickness" >}}

I don't think this card needs me to waste any more words on how good it is. It's powerful. I considered it for the [mono-red slice][red], but I don't think that cube needs another card to send {{< card Through the Breach >}}. I thought about it for the [multiplayer slice][multiplayer], but I don't think it's interesting enough there (it's just like 19 mana worth of spells for 7 mana). But you know where it _can_ go? The [Timmy slice][timmy].


### Invasion of Kaldheim

{{< card-listing "Invasion of Kaldheim" "Pyre of the World Tree" >}}

Red got some sweet battle designs! I don't think this one is worth it—I wish I could just cast the back side drectly in the [graveyard slice][graveyard], but I don't think it's worth the effort of going through the front side _and_ attacking down a battle. But! I actually love the front side's effect from a mechanical perspective (a "rummage your whole hand away" effect where you don't lose access to the original hand at first), and I hope to see more of it in the future. In particular, I'd like to see something like

> Exile your hand, then draw that many cards. Until [end of turn // the end of your next turn], you may play the exiled cards.


### Invasion of Karsus

{{< card-listing "Invasion of Karsus" "Refraction Elemental" >}}

Hmm, the back side of this is obviously a game-winning bomb, but at 4 defense I kinda want the front side of a battle to be good on its own (or to help you flip it somehow). I prefer my 3-damage sweepers to cost 3 ({{< card Anger of the Gods >}} // {{< card Sweltering Suns >}} // {{< card "Brotherhood's End" >}}), and at 4 mana we also have {{< card "Storm's Wrath" >}}.

Which is all a lot of words to say: I think this is cube-able, but you have to be willing to let your red sweeper be less efficient, and you have to have a red deck that's willing to send 4+ damage at not-your-opponent's-face.


### Invasion of Mercadia

{{< card-listing "Invasion of Mercadia" "Kyren Flamewright" >}}

This is my new favorite {{< card Tormenting Voice >}} effect! I didn't have one yet in the [graveyard slice][graveyard], so it's going in over {{< card Crashing Footfalls >}} (which has actually never been cast—I checked!). I love the idea of a marginally playable card selection spell early in the game that can turn into a win condition _that's also a discard outlet!_


### Invasion of Regatha

{{< card-listing "Invasion of Regatha" "Disciples of the Inferno" >}}

Okay, this one is probably the worst red battle in a cube setting (or rather, in a _singleton_ setting...). It's 3 mana, not very impactful on average, and hard to flip, though it does pay you off nicely if you can flip it. The most common way I've seen to flip an Invasion of Regatha is with a second copy of Invasion of Regatha, and they kinda snowball from there. So where do i think this is viable? A combat-oriented cube that's willing to break singleton. That's pretty narrow, but I bet there's one out there.


### Invasion of Tarkir

{{< card-listing "Invasion of Tarkir" "Defiant Thundermaw" >}}

Now _here. we. go._ This is a hell of a card. It's seeing legacy play, and I think it's playable in a wide variety of cubes. The frotn face probably kills something, even if it trades down in terms of mana value (and it doesn't always trade down!). It's hard to flip, but the back face kills people very quickly, and it doesn't ask very much of you.

Going in the [red cube][red], no question, especially since there's enough dragons in there that you'll soemtimes get to reveal one!


### Khenra Spellspear

{{< card-listing "Khenra Spellspear" "Gitaxian Spellstalker" >}}

Now here's a fun [spellslinger][spellslinger] card! It's no {{< card Kiln Fiend >}}, but if you can find an opportunity to transform it, you get a must-kill threat that costs extra to kill. It won't be the best card in red, but I think it'll be fun to play and good enough to make the cut in prowess-y decks.


### Urabrask

{{< card-listing "Urabrask" "The Great Work" >}}

Okay, I like this one. Yes, yes, yes, a 4-mana 4/4 first strike is impossible to attack through, and thoroughly stopping combat that early isn't always _ideal_, but at least this doesn't dramatically overpower every creature at that spot on the curve, bog down the game with triggers, or 2-for-1 your opponent _while_ being a pile of stats.

Yes, I'm a little bitter about the rest of them.

But this one is a second {{< xcard name="Birgi, God of Storytelling" label="Birgi" />}} for stormy decks, and a bit of a win condition in those decks by getting in for not-insignificant damage with its trigger. Flipping it probably wins the game but is neither free (you have to build toward it) nor necessary (you can do a "slow storm" approach where you lean more on the damage from the triggers). I like the flexibility. It's going in the [mono-red slice][red] and the [spellslinger slice][spellslinger], but I'm prepared for the possibility that the body is too good for the latter.

### Volcanic Spite

{{< card-listing "Volcanic Spite" >}}

Strict upgrade over {{< card Fire Prophecy >}}. Nice, I like it! Probably an auto-include in pauper and pioneer cubes. Maybe even artisan/peasant cubes.


### Voldaren Thrillseeker

{{< card-listing "Voldaren Thrillseeker" >}}

I don't think this is generally cubeable, but I want the {{< mana rg >}} archetype in the forthcoming [token slice][tokens] to be "fling", and this is probably extremely playable there.


### Wrenn's Resolve

{{< card-listing "Wrenn's Resolve" >}}

Functional reprint of {{< card Reckless Impulse >}}. Nice to have two of them in some cases without breaking singleton. In particular I could imagine pauper decks wanting that. I'll probably be replacing my Reckless Impulses with this one because I like the flavor better.


## Green


### Ancient Imperiosaur

{{< card-listing "Ancient Imperiosaur" >}}

Here's another one for the "huge green beater" pile with the {{< card Questing Beast >}} and the {{< card Tyrranax Rex >}} and friends. This one distinguishes itself by having some built-in cost reduction, so it rewards running it in the same shape of deck that'd want a {{< card Craterhoof Behemoth >}}.

I still don't have space in any of my cubes for this type of card when it doesn't support the theme of the cube, but like I said about {{< card Meeting of the Minds >}}, more options is better.


### Atraxa's Fall

{{< card-listing "Atraxa's Fall" >}}

So one of the consequences of building small, heavily-themed cubes is that they often can't supoort just a regular old {{< card Naturalize >}}. Why run that when I can run Naturalize-with-set's-mechanic, which might see marginal maindeck play? Well, this one does enough things that it's starting to look more attractive. Maybe I'll find a good place for a {{< card Naturalize >}}//{{< card Plummet >}} split card?


### Deeproot Wanderer

{{< card-listing "Deeproot Wanderer" >}}

I'm a little dubious about whether this will perform well, but I'm going to give it a try in the [graveyard slice][graveyard] because the upside is clearly there. I'm just nervous about the need for it to connect. But hey, it's well-statted for its cost, and if it gets in even once that's real value.


### Doomskar Warrior

{{< card-listing "Doomskar Warrior" >}}

See previous comments about not having much room for generically powerful cards that don't fit my cubes' themes. I think this is extremely cubeable in most environments, anywhere green midrange is a thing. It's a lot of stats, and if it (or the thing it backs up!) starts getting hits in it will run away with the game.


### Glistening Dawn

{{< card-listing "Glistening Dawn" >}}

Not much to say here. This is a very commander-y card and may fit well in commander-y cubes. I bought 2 because I assume I'll find commander decks that want it, but in the mean time I might throw it into the {{< card Lore Seeker >}} pool for the [multiplayer slice][multiplayer].


### Invasion of Ikoria

{{< card-listing "Invasion of Ikoria" "Zilortha, Apex of Ikoria" >}}

This is a {{< card "Green Sun's Zenith" >}}-alike and goes in cubes that want that kind of thing, which is not (at present) any of mine. It has some significant upside over classic GSZ that I think justifies the mana, but I do think {{< card Finale of Devastation >}} is better due to occasionally being a {{< xcard name="Createrhoof Behemoth" label="Craterhoof" />}}.


### Invasion of Ixalan

{{< card-listing "Invasion of Ixalan" "Belligerent Regisaur" >}}

I'm willing to be wrong here, but I'm not super impressed. Green has good 0- and 1-mana cantrips, so I don't think it needs a 2-mana cantrip, even if it comes with a beefy creature later. Green doesn't have a hard time finding beefy creatures.

Would I play a {{< mana 1 g >}} sorcery that drew me a permanent card and a 4/3 trampler that comes on suspend for a few turns? Certainly. Would I spend a cube slot on that card? That I'm less sure of.


### Invasion of Shandalar

{{< card-listing "Invasion of Shandalar" "Leyline Surge" >}}

I'm going to give this a try in the [graveyard slice][graveyard]. It's enough value on the front side that I don't know if you have to be able to flip it to be worth playing. It's nontrivial but also far from impossible to flip if you can see a path to getting some advantage from that. In the graveyard slice in particular, I'm imagining this in the {{< mana gu >}} deck, cycling a {{< card Titanoth Rex >}} or channeling a {{< card Colossal Skyturtle >}}, returning it with the front face of this, then cheating them in with the back face.


### Invasion of Zendikar

{{< card-listing "Invasion of Zendikar" "Awakened Skyclave" >}}

{{< xcard name="Explosive Vegetation" label="Veggies" />}} with set's mechanic! Going to give it a try in the [graveyard slice][graveyard] over {{< card "Migration's Path" >}}, the previous veggies with set's mechanic.


### Kami of Whispered Hopes, Ozolith

{{< card-listing "Kami of Whispered Hopes" "Ozolith, the Shattered Spire" >}}

I almost feel like WotC is printing too many of this effect (and the counter doublers). I really dislike that these are both in the same set and they work subtly differently. Anyway, if you want these you know it already.


### Timberland Ancient

{{< card-listing "Timberland Ancient" >}}

Hey look, another landcycler. Just like with the blue one, nobody casts {{< card Elvish Aberration >}} in the [graveyard slice][graveyard], so there's little harm in trying this out. I'm actually optimistic that Timberland Ancient will attack and block in the cube, because {{< mana gu >}} has a tendency to want to cycle and reanimate huge things.


### Tribute to the World Tree

{{< card-listing "Tribute to the World Tree" >}}

I'm not sure about paying {{< mana g g g >}} for this, but let's jam it into the [spellslinger slice][spellslinger] and see if there's a token deck that wants it.


### Vorinclex

{{< card-listing "Vorinclex" "The Grand Evolution" >}}

And the final score for "interesting praetor designs for cube" is 1/5. If you want to put a {{< card Primeval Titan >}} into your cube, just put a Primeval Titan into your cube.


## Gold

I'm going to skip over almost all of these, in part because I've already written quite a bit for this, and in part because there's _so. many. words._ A lot of the designs are very cool! I want to build commander decks around a few of them! But they're novellas. The line for gold cards to make a cube is so much higher, and with two exceptions, I don't think these make any of mine. Many (many!) of them are cubeable, but they'll come up in the relevant Scryfall searches when you're building a cube that wants them. Yes, {{< card Thalia and The Gitrog Monster >}} is powerful, and if you have a lands theme you might want it.


### Invasion of Alara

{{< card-listing "Invasion of Alara" "Awaken the Maelstrom" >}}

Auto-include in the [Timmy slice][timmy] because it just does so many things. Look at all the things it does! The back does five!


### Invasion of Tolvada

{{< card-listing "Invasion of Tolvada" "The Broken Sky" >}}

This card is awesome. Type-agnostic reanimation at 5, and if you flip it you get a piece of inevitability that self-enables. This is going in the [token slice][tokens], and I personally want to see if I can return a {{< card Marionette Master >}} with the front face.


## Commander

There's a whole other set adjacent to this set! As with the main set gold cards, I'm going to gloss over most of these, this time because they tend to be focused more on commander play. They're often either more expensive than most cubes will support, or very narrowly focused (which may work if what they're doing aligns witha cube! That's where most of the ones noted below come from.)


### Chilvalric Alliance

{{< card-listing "Chilvalric Alliance" >}}

Card seems nuts, I don't know what else to say. If you can get yourself into a place where you can attack and trigger it, this card will keep the gas flowing, allow you to convert lands and blanks into uncounterable bears, and you'll get to keep attacking and triggering it. I'm going to start it in the [tokens slice][tokens], but I'm prepared for it to be too good.


### Dance with Calamity

{{< card-listing "Dance with Calamity" >}}

Fun subgame, very [Timmy][timmy] card. May also go in the {{< card Lore Seeker >}} pool for the [multiplayer slice][multiplayer].


### Hedron Detonator

{{< card-listing "Hedron Detonator" >}}

Great engine piece for the [tokens slice][tokens].


### Pain Distributor

{{< card-listing "Pain Distributor" >}}

I'm going to try to fit this into the [multiplayer slice][multiplayer] because I like the group slug aspect of it.


### Bitterthorn, Nissa's Animus

{{< card-listing "Bitterthorn, Nissa's Animus" >}}

Hmm, I'm not sure about this one. That {{< mana 3 >}} to equip is a _lot_. In all but the slowest cubes, I can't imagine equipping this more than once unless there's some direct support for that kind of thing. And attacking with this once doesn't really get the job done (unless a slightly slower {{< card "Pilgrim's Eye" >}} is an okay card). If you have to pay 6 mana total to get the second land, is that okay?

I think I've talked myself out of it.


### Talents

{{< card-listing "Elspeth's Talent" "Teferi's Talent" "Liliana's Talent" "Rowan's Talent" "Vivien's Talent" >}}

Okay, _fiiiine_, that seals it. I'll figure out a way to make a cube with a proper superfriends deck. Maybe it's the [Timmy slice][timmy]. Maybe it's a dedicated planeswalker cube. Not sure yet, but the pieces are there.


### Firemane Commando

{{< card-listing "Firemane Commando" >}}

This is an ideal card for the [multiplayer slice][multiplayer]! I like cards that encourage attacking (or otherwise push the game towards a conclusion), to fight the tendency of multiplayer games to stall. That makes political cards at little tricky, because I don't want them to incentivize _not_ attacking. That's why I love this design: it directly rewards your opponents for getting into the red zone, as long as they're attacking each other.


## Aftermath

What's this?! A _third_ set? Well, there's only 50 cards, so let's get into it.


### Deification

{{< card-listing "Deification" >}}

Once again, I'm getting the message that I should be doing something with planeswalkers. There's just been a bunch of cards over the last few sets that point in that direction.


### Filter Out

{{< card-listing "Filter Out" >}}

I kinda want to try this out in the [echantment slice][enchantment]. I'm not 100% sure it needs a sweeper, but if it could benefit from one it'd be one like this. I'm also going to have to see this in action before I understand how powerful it is, but the low cost is intriguing.


### Tolarian Contempt

{{< card-listing "Tolarian Contempt" >}}

Going to try this out in the [multiplayer slice][multiplayer], for similar reasons to {{< card Invasion of Fiora >}}: the cube also has no blue sweepers, and this is one that feels fundamentally blue and doesn't violate the "let the players do the thing" principle.


### Narset, Enlightened Exile

{{< card-listing "Narset, Enlightened Exile" >}}

The single most exciting Aftermath card for me, and I don't even think it's that generally cubeable (the mana cost is rough). But the [enchantment slice][enchantment] has a set of wedge-colored signposts, and some are... better than others. This feels like a better heroic/auras signal than {{< card Jeskai Ascendency >}}, which reads as a combo card. Plus, Narset can fish auras out of the graveyard and help with the deck's long game.


## Honorable Mention

### Every Ravnica Showcase Frame Card

{{< xcard-listing "1e7c2afb-e04e-4012-b8a2-7a7273b52136" "df48f1c0-b336-4c68-8d11-41bceb36c83c" "0a1b14a8-c194-49d3-ab6c-1db377b69495" "c94cd726-8d67-4510-ad56-3ead1931214b" "cf0d7769-d98e-4cf2-900e-11dc74142c0d" "f21d999f-ea24-40d8-86ef-180627196749" "3c48a7da-0d01-439f-8cfb-22af30cffbba" "577522b4-b3f6-43b6-92a4-4e8420ff3b12" "61243a31-6608-451f-9ba1-4f8ecc5aaad1" >}}

Absolutely gorgeous. If anyone from WotC is reading this: please tell whoever made the Ravnica showcase frames that they did an excellent job. They're my absolute favorites, and I hope to see more in the future.
