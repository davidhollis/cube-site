Hello, folks! This is my first set review of any kind in any medium, and let me just say that I have a newfound respect for all the people out there who manage to write something about every single card in a set! This is a lot more informal than most of those reviews—it's just my rough thoughts about the cards in the set that I feel like I have anything to say about, mostly in the context of my cubes/future cube ideas. I skip or gloss over some very good cards, and I spend a bit of time musing about cards that may not end up doing much.

<!--more-->

Enough with the intro material, though—let's get to the cards!

{{< toc >}}

## White

### Against All Odds

{{< card-listing "Against All Odds" >}}

This kinda does what two different white decks in the [graveyard cube][graveyard] want to be doing, but I don't think a 4-mana sorcery can really displace anything that's currently there. Worth remembering though in case this could have a place in a future, lower-power cube.

### Basilica Shepherd, Crawling Chorus

{{< card-listing "Basilica Shepherd" "Crawling Chorus" >}}

I don't think either of these has a home in any of my current cubes, but the fact that they make tokens at a reasonable rate (and those tokens are artifacts!) makes me think they're worthy of consideration in the [token cube][tokens], especially the Chorus.

### Elesh Norn, Mother of Machines

{{< card-listing "Elesh Norn, Mother of Machines" >}}

I feel like I'm legally required to think about including this in the [multiplayer cube][multiplayer], a commander-y cube with a blink deck, but I'm not sure I like the gameplay implications of the last ability. I'm especially concerned that Norn could be played _against_ the blink deck. Maybe if I open one it'll end up in the {{< card Lore Seeker >}} pile so we can try it out once.

### Mondrak, Glory Dominus

{{< card-listing "Mondrak, Glory Dominus" >}}

I can't imagine a world where this doesn't make it into the [token cube][tokens] when I get that list together. I like {{< card Anointed Procession >}} procession more as a creature than as an enchantment in that context.

### Ossification, Planar Disruption

{{< card-listing "Ossification" "Planar Disruption" >}}

Oooh, some very nice enchantment-based removal here. I'm absolutely checking to see if I can find room for these in the [enchantment cube][enchantments]. I'm not sure they both make it in since they hit roughly the same set of targets, but a strict upgrade to {{< card Pacifism >}} and what's mostly[^1] a better {{< card Journey to Nowhere >}} are exciting in a lot of contexts.

I've also been on the lookout for some sorcery-speed creature removal for the [tribal soup cube][tribal], and these fit the brief very nicely.

[^1]: There just aren't enough nonbasics to punish someone for running a card that says, "Enchant basic land you control"

### Skrelv, Defector Mite

{{< card-listing "Skrelv, Defector Mite" >}}

I don't have a specific home in mind for this, but there's a lot of room for a {{< card Mother of Runes >}} effect south of Mom herself. Put another way, I suspect I'll find a home for "Mom, but less so" at some point, and I'll be looking to get a copy of the little bug in anticipation of that.

### Skrelv's Hive

{{< card-listing "Skrelv's Hive" >}}

This is exactly the kind of thing I want for white in the [token cube][tokens]: a repeatable way to make tokens, and those tokens happen to be artifacts and creatures, fitting nicely into the decks that want either. The token cube is also probably not going to be powerful enough to support actual {{< card Bitterblossom >}}, so this is a welcome step down from there.


## Blue

### Experimental Augury

{{< card-listing "Experimental Augury" >}}

I don't have a specific home in mind for this one, but I'm filing it away. It's a 2-mana instant that does two useful things. It'll be good somewhere.

### Ichormoon Gauntlet

{{< card-listing "Ichormoon Gauntlet" >}}

The mere existence of this card makes me want to make a cube with enough planeswalkers for it. That is all.

### Mercurial Spelldancer

{{< card-listing "Mercurial Spelldancer" >}}

I'm not 100% sure this makes it into the [spellslinger cube][spellslinger], but it's such a unique effect that I feel like I must try it.


## Black

### Black Sun's Twilight

{{< card-listing "Black Sun's Twilight" >}}

I don't know where exactly this fits, but "kill a creature and reanimate" on a single card for 6 mana has high enough upside that I'll probably grab a copy in case I want it one day.

### Drown in Ichor

{{< card-listing "Drown in Ichor" >}}

Much like {{< card Experimental Augury >}}, a single card that does two different useful things for 2 mana is worth some space in my mind for the future.

### Offer Immortality

{{< card-listing "Offer Immortality" >}}

Okay, this isn't good enough for any cube I own or have plans to build, but that's a damn shame because Amanda Sartor's art is stunning.


## Red

### All Will Be One

{{< card-listing "All Will Be One" >}}

Okay, this is is definitely a win condition in some very narrow cube I have yet to design. Maybe the [Timmy cube][timmy]?

### Blazing Crescendo

{{< card-listing "Blazing Crescendo" >}}

Blazing Crescendo is far and away the card I'm most excited about for my existing cubes. It's certainly going in the [spellslinger cube][spellslinger], where it interacts very nicely with {{< xcard name="Zada, Hedron Grinder" label="Zada" />}}, {{< card Ogre Battlecaster >}}, and all the prowess-y and {{< card Kiln Fiend >}}-y things. It may even be strong enough to make it into the [mono-red cube][red].

Plus, the art's extremely sweet.

### Gleeful Demolition

{{< card-listing "Gleeful Demolition" >}}

I'm _very_ into a new play on {{< card Kuldotha Rebirth >}}, especially one that can be a {{< card Smelt >}} in a pinch. This has a home in the [red cube][red], and will be a key card in some red decks in the [token cube][tokens].

### Hexgold Slash

{{< card-listing "Hexgold Slash" >}}

On the off-chance anyone at WotC is reading this, please continue to commission art from Eli Minaya.

### Solphim, Mayhem Dominus

{{< card-listing "Solphim, Mayhem Dominus" >}}

A 4-mana one-sided {{< card Furnace of Rath >}} that also happens to be stapled to a 5-power creature that doesn't die to {{< card Lightning Bolt >}}[^2]? Yes, please. I'll be finding room for this in the [red cube][red], for sure.

[^2]: and especially doesn't die to very much once you can activate its ability

### Urabrask's Forge

{{< card-listing "Urabrask's Forge" >}}

An artifact that makes an artifact token every turn, including the turn you play it, is immediately in the conversation for the [token cube][tokens]. It remains to be seen whether this costing 3 is too much of an obstacle, but either way this'll be on the initial list for that cube before I start making cuts.


## Green

### Bloated Contaminator

{{< card-listing "Bloated Contaminator" >}}

I don't support poison in any of my cubes at the moment, but if I ever do in a future cube this is one of the first cards to add. It's just a ball of stats, and it enables itself.

### Nissa, Ascended Animist

{{< card-listing "Nissa, Ascended Animist" >}}

Card seems strong. Even if it's expensive, it occupies 3 different spots on the curve and does useful things at each place (even if all of those things are "make large token or {{< card Naturalize >}}"). But even at 5 I can't discount a planeswalker that goes up in loyalty to make huge creatures.

All that said, I don't know where this goes among my cubes, so this might be yet another one that I file away in the good stuff box.

### Thirsting Roots

{{< card-listing "Thirsting Roots" >}}

No specific plans for Thirsting Roots, but if this and {{< card Bushwhack >}} from BRO herald a new series of modal "{{< card Lay of the Land >}} // small effect" spells costing only {{< mana g >}}, I'm very intrigued. One of those will make it in somewhere.

### Thrun, Breaker of Silence, Tyrranax Rex

{{< card-listing "Thrun, Breaker of Silence" "Tyrranax Rex" >}}

Two more card to throw into the stack of "very large green creatures that are roughly impossible to deal with". No cube wants too many of them, but they all fit in slightly differently. None of my current cubes are set up in a way where this type of card would be a fun addition, but if some type of [power cube][power] ever happens, it probably wants one.

### Tyvar's Stand

{{< card-listing "Tyvar's Stand" >}}

Tyvar's Stand may very well be nothing, but perhaps there's an environment that wants a more flexible version of {{< card Blossoming Defense >}}. It certainly does a lot of things. In a more combat-focused cube, it does kind of read "target creature wins any fight".


## Gold

### Kaya, Intangible Slayer

{{< card-listing "Kaya, Intangible Slayer" >}}

That's one hell of a 7-mana planeswalker. She's doesn't just win you the game on the spot, which is a tough sell given how much she costs, but in a fair cube she certainly gets you out of a lot of bad situations. The {{< mana wb >}} slots in the [enchantment cube][enchantments] are a bit tight, but I do kind want to try her out there given how her -3 interacts with enchantments.

### Nahiri, the Unforgiving

{{< card-listing "Nahiri, the Unforgiving" >}}

She doesn't protect herself very well, but she also enters with a fair amount of loyalty for a 4-mana walker, and she really demands an answer. I could see trying her in any of the [graveyard][graveyard], [multiplayer][multiplayer], or [token][tokens] cubes.


## Artifacts

### The Skullbombs

{{< card-listing "Basilica Skullbomb" "Surgical Skullbomb" "Dross Skullbomb" "Furnace Skullbomb" "Maze Skullbomb" >}}

Love me some eggs. I don't think I'm really in for any of these outside the blue or black ones (and even then I don't have any immediate idea of which of my current cubes they'd fit into), but I've learned never to discount a 1-mana artifact that you can sacrifice for an effect.

### Sword of Forge and Frontier

{{< card-listing "Sword of Forge and Frontier" >}}

Look, it's a sword. There's a pretty high floor on just being a {{< mana 3 >}} / Equip {{< mana 2 >}} that gives +2/+2 and protection from two colors. I'm currently including {{< xcard name="Sword of Sinew and Steel" label="Sinew and Steel" />}} in the [red cube][red], but if the repeated artifact removal of that one end s up being too oppressive, I think Forge and Frontier is the next sword I'd try in that place.

### Otharri, Suns' Glory

{{< card-listing "Otharri, Suns' Glory" >}}

This one has some interesting potential in my [multiplayer cube][multiplayer]. The current {{< mana rw >}} slot is home to {{< card "Aurelia, the Warleader" >}}. One of the rough edges with Aurelia is doubling her trigger doesn't really work like you want it to. Otharri neatly sidesteps that issue, and while it's better on an empty board than Aurelia is, it doesn't just simply end the game immediately the way she sometimes can.


## Lands

### The Common Spheres

{{< card-listing "The Fair Basilica" "The Surgical Bay" "The Dross Pits" "The Autonomous Furnace" "The Hunter Maze" >}}

I love that these exist. I think they're in the same power band as the other two groups of monocolor cycling lands, but they play differently: they're still flood insurance, but they're better earlier in the game, whereas if you drew one later in the game you'd rather it be a cycling land.

The only cube I have that includes a cycle of cycling lands is the [graveyard cube][graveyard], and it cares a lot about the word "cycling" appearing on the card. So, I don't think I'll be putting them anywhere yet, but I'll bet I find somewhere they fit eventually.
